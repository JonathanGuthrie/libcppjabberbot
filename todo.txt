done) define stanza base class

done) build client class with ability to transmit certain defined stanzas

done) build client class with ability with ability to understand and dispatch
  a couple of different select stanzas (login and register)

done)  Add a callback framework for non-response stanzas received

done)  Extend the callback framework to allow callbacks for stanzas that don't have namespaces

done)  Add the other stanzas needed to implement the affirmation bot

7)  Doxygen comments and a mechanism to build documentation from them

8)  The other namespaces in the book

9)  Add X-substanzas, and the other namespaces that go with them

10)  Add some mechanism for doing registration the way you're supposed to, by 
doing a get on the registration to get the fields and then making sure they're
all there.

11)  Split the socket class out.  (Too bad boost won't do the right job.)

12)  Implement XMPP as well as (or instead of) Jabber

13)  Licensing.  Put the code under a specific license and all the BS that implies.

14)  Define a subscription management system that wraps the low-level operations with higher-level logic.

15)  Add a default stanza type so the system is never confused about an incoming stanza

16)  Add a mechanism to allow for plugins for stanza types and build the extant
stanza types as plugins.  Plugins?  If my stanzas are used for both sending and receiving,
then how do I send one that's in a plugin.  Table this until I have a clue.  (Could be
a while.)

17)  Other things that occur to me.
